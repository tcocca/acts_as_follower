ActsAsFollower Methods

- To have a Model object start following another use the following:

		book = Book.find(1)
		current_user.follow(book) # Creates a record for the current_user as the follower and the book as the followable

- To stop following a Model object use the following

		current_user.stop_following(book) # Deletes that record in the Follow table

- You can check to see if a Model that acts_as_follower is following a Model acts_as_followable through the following:

		current_user.following?(book) # Returns true or false

- To get all of the records that a Model is following use the following on a model that acts_as_follower

		current_user.all_follows # Returns an array of every follow for the current_user
		
- To get all follows by a certain type use the following on a model that acts_as_follower

		current_user.follows_by_type('Book') # Returns an array of all follows for current user where followable_type is 'Book'
		
- To get the total number (count) of follows for a user use the following on a model that acts_as_follower

		current_user.follow_count # Returns and integer


# ActsAsFollowable Methods

Comments
=======

If anyone has comments or questions please let me know (tom dot cocca at gmail dot com)
If you have updates or patches or want to contribute I would love to see what you have or want to add

Props go out to Pete Jackson on his VoteFu plugin which is what I took the majority of the design pattern for this plugin from:
See Pete's plugin here: http://github.com/peteonrails/vote_fu/tree/master

Also Pete based his plugin off of acts_as_voteable and acts_as_commentable so I should give props there as well.

Thank you Pete!


TODO
=======

* Testing
* Add Example Usage code to the plugin
* Possibly add hooks for model observer code or after_save or after_update code
	- Any ideas on this are more than welcome, just email me.
