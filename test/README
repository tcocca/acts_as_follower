Testing
=======

Tests are written with Shoulda on top of Test::Unit and Factory Girl is used instead of fixtures.  Tests are run using rake.

1. Clone your fork git locally.
2. Install the dependencies
    $ bundle install
3. Run the tests:
    rake test


Coverage
=======

Test coverage can be calculated using Rcov. Make sure you have the rcov gem installed.

Again in the acts_as_follower directory:

rake rcov:gen DB=sqlite3   # For sqlite

The coverage will now be available in the test/coverage directory.

rake rcov:clobber will delete the coverage directory.
